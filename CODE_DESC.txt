Description of files: 

BH_0_spin.png = generated image of a black hole where the observer is at an angle of 85 deg with the black hole, the spin parameter is 0.99 and the outer radius is 20.0. All other variables remain unchanged in the code 
BH_99_40deg.png = generated image of a black hole where the observer is at an angle of 40 deg with the BH, the spin parameter is 0.99. The outer radius is 20.0. 
All other generated images of the BH appear in the file project_report.png to not clutter the git report
EoM.h = Metric equations are defined here 
Error of orbits.png = error of all orbits from Test Case 2 displayed on graph 
implement.cpp = implementation of test cases 1 and 2 
output_test_case_1.csv = raw output of test case 1 
output_test_case_1xy.csv= test case 1 output with converted coordinates 
output_test_case_2{A-D}.csv = test case output, can be graphed with k3d in python 
output_test_case2{A-D}_error.csv = error of the unstable orbit with corresponding title (e.g error A corresponds to error of orbit A)
project_report.pdf = findings summarized with clearer Description
raytracing_test.csv = output of raytacing.cpp
raytracing.cpp = code for raytracing an image of a black hole. produces 2D array of pixel intensities 
raytracing.ipynb = code for taking raytacing_test.csv and creating an image 
rk4_adaptive.h = intergration method used 
test_1.ipynb = code for producing graphs for test 1 
test_2.ipynb = code for producing graphs for test 2 
test_case_1.png = test case 1, photon does 1 loop
test_case _2.png = test case 2, photon does 2 loops 
test_case_2{A-D}_error.png = error graph for photon orbit 
test_case_2{A-D}.png = images of k3d generated graphs of unstable photon orbits from test case 2
